# nadia-schmidtke-resume

My (GitHub-hosted) website with the purpose of providing an informal resume and consolidating links to my online presence. 

## Description

Currently, consists of 4 web pages:
- Home
- About
- Projects
- Contact (via email)
- (and a link to my WordPress blog)

Working on making improvements like making it slightly more responsive and updating the links and background colous.
