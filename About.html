            <h2>My Motivation.</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="long-blurb-text">I've always been driven by a desire to uncover how, and even why, things work
                the way they do. This underpins my academic career in which I obtained her Master of Science degree in
                Human Kinetics and Ergonomics. The
                disciple, which is concerned with examining and optimising the interaction between humans and their
                work, is also known as Human Factors. My original research project examined different metrics of
                cognitive workload during real-world driving. The aim was to determine which metric is best suited to
                indicating mental work on the road.<br><br>
                My current focus is on expanding my skillset to include practical software engineering. I am
                driven to apply my programming knowledge to fields related to health and work. I am currently
                expanding my Java and Python knowledge to include SQL and machine learning aspects.<br><br>
                In addition to physical health, I'm passionate about mental health and its importance in society.
                I am proudly South African and wish to contribute my skill set to positive growth in the
                country.
